# Discover / Requirements
We will be collecting the data of the different age groups in Lancaster.
Our goal is to create a line plot representing the different age groups in Lancaster County.
This data would be good for business reasons to see what kind of audience you are dealing with in Lancaster.
#Collection
Our data was collected in this step. What I did was get a csv file that had the data of multiple areas in PA and their population through multiple years
#Data Prep Cleaning
In this step I started cleaning out my data. What I did was I started to get of rid of the lines that I was not going to need. I narrowed down my search to just the area of Lancaster and the population for both females and males in the year of 2017. Once my data was cleaned down I knew I could use this as my csv file. I made sure that there wasn't any typos or any unwanted data.
#Planning
This is where I started to see trends in my data. I noticed that the age dipped and went back up. This is when I knew a line plot would be good for my data. I started cleaning down my data further by getting rid of unwanted years that I was not using.
#Modeling
In the modeling stage I started to brake down my data more. I started to add some of the data together. I added the ages by decades instead of having the ages separate.
#Computation
In this step I wanted to create my lab using python. What I did was download a program called anaconda. Once I downloaded anaconda I used jupyter to help me code my plot. I also used matplotlib inside of jupyter.
#findings Review
In this step I found out that my plot worked! I saw that my data needed further work into I had to go back in the steps to try to figure out what was the issue with the Y-axis plots. I rinse and repeated these steps.
